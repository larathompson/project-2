# Songify - Hackathon

# Overview

This hackathon was my second project that I completed over the course of 2 days, working with a pair. My pair and I built a React app which consumed the Deezer API in order to create a database which provided albums created by the users artist of choice.

# Brief

Listed below are the requirements that the app had to meet.

The app had to:

- Consume a public API – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
- Have several components - At least one classical and one functional.
- The app should include a router - with several "pages".
- Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.
- Have semantically clean HTML - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public.
